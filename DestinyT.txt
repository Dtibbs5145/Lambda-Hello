Hello, my name is Destiny Tibbitts.
Three words that describe me would be caring, motivated, and humble.
I would say my hoobies are learning to code and being a mom.
I love being a mom because there is nothing better than seeing my daughter run around outside or try to mimic words or actions.
Seeing her grow and knowing she looks up to me fills my heart with love.
Coding is another activity I love because, despite how stressful it can be, and the fact that it's already made me cry, it is very intriguing and evergrowing.
There are not a lack of jobs for coding, either, which is a big positive as well.
My favorite animal is an octopus because of how intelligent they are.
Coding makes me feel like a spy.
Or like I'm saving the world.
Both are very nice.
